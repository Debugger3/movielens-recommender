Part of a final project for a graduate course in Data Analytics at the University of Toronto (Winter term, 2016). Our group set out to create a movie recommendation engine that would recommend movies that would have a high chance of being enjoyed by the user.

## Background

This was a final project for a graduate course offered in the Winter Term (January-April, 2016) at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Information: INF2190 Data Analytics: Introduction, Methods, and Practical Approaches. Our group's full tech stack for this project was expressed in the acronym *MIPAW*: MySQL, IBM SPSS Modeler, Python, AWS, and Weka.

Running the model on a sample of the MovieLens movie ratings data produced movie recommendations where >85% would produce favorable ratings.
