Part of a final project for a graduate course in Data Analytics at the University of Toronto (Winter term, 2016). Our group set out to create a movie recommendation engine that would recommend movies that would have a high chance of being enjoyed by the user.

## Background

This was a final project for a graduate course offered in the Winter Term (January-April, 2016) at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Information: INF2190 Data Analytics: Introduction, Methods, and Practical Approaches. Our group's full tech stack for this project was expressed in the acronym *MIPAW*: MySQL, IBM SPSS Modeler, Python, AWS, and Weka.

Running the model on a sample of the MovieLens movie ratings data produced movie recommendations where >85% would produce favorable ratings.

## Datasets

The following main data sources were used for this project.

- [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- [MovieLens Tag Genome](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/tag-genome/)
- [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces)

### MovieLens 

The MovieLens movie ratings data is provided by GroupLens Research in datasets ranging in size from 100K to 20 million. There is a "Latest" dataset that includes more recent ratings data up to 2016. Our team chose to use the stable 20 million (MovieLens 20M) count dataset and the Latest dataset.

### MovieLens Tag Genome

Tag Genome data is also from GroupLens Research. In this dataset, the relevance of certain tags to a range of movies was calculated using a machine learning algorithm by the research team.
